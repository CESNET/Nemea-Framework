# About pytrap

This directory contains an implementation of Python extension.  The aim
is to allow native calls of base TRAP functionality (used by NEMEA modules).

# Installation

Development package of Python is required (python-devel, python3-devel etc.
according to your OS distribution).  It contains needed header files.

Since this module uses libtrap and libunirec, https:/github.com/CESNET/Nemea-framework
must be installed in the system.

When all requirements are met, run as root:

```
python setup.py install
```

Note: for different versions of python, it is needed to perform this command
separately for each of them.

# Help

Help is contained in the python module.  After successful installation run in
a python interactive interpret:

```python
import pytrap
help(pytrap)
```
