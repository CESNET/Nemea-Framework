Nemea Framework
===============

This repository contains base libraries for a [Nemea system](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea).
The Nemea system is a modular system that consists of 
independent modules for network traffic analysis and anomaly
detection.

The framework consists of:
 * [libtrap](./libtrap) -- communication interface for messages transfer between Nemea modules
 * [UniRec](./unirec) -- flexible and efficient data format of flow-records
 * [common](./common) -- usefull common functions and data structures
 * [pytrap](./pytrap) -- python wrapper for libtrap and UniRec that allows development of nemea modules in python
 * [pycommon](./pycommon) -- python common modules and methods, there is currently a support of alerts creation in the [IDEA](https://idea.cesnet.cz/en/index) format that can be stored into MongoDB or sent to the [Warden](https://wardenw.cesnet.cz/) incident sharing system
