		New enhanced version of buffering that uses ring buffer.
2019-05-18 libtrap-1.13.1

2019-02-07 libtrap-1.12.2
	* Bugfix in init - possible deadlock on uninitialized semaphore

2018-11-23 libtrap-0.12.1
	* libtrap:
		Libtrap buffer now properly empties itself if no client is
		connected to the ouput interface. (This changes how statistics
		- number of messages sent and dropped - are treated when
		no client is connected).

		Added client identification for TCP and UNIX output interfaces
		and computation of statistics. For UNIX IFC type, ID is set to PID of the connected client.
		For TCP or TLS IFC types, ID is set to a remote TCP port of the connected
		client (which can be looked up using `netstat(8)` or `ss(8)`).

2018-10-26 libtrap-0.12.0
	* libtrap:
		Refactoring, improved throughput.
		Fixed problems with not setting trap last error.
		Most of the context functions are now thread safe.
		Autoflush is no longer called in situations when send procedure keeps failing repeatedly.
		Added periodical interface statistics printings when run in verbose mode.
		Improved documentation.

		Fix non-blocking recv in libtrap.
		Fix possible write to uninitialized address.
		Improved VERBOSE CPP macro to print file&line in debug.
